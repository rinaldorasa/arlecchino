Minimalistic code
This is an attempt to have a basic pattern for working with bootstrap. 
A kind of reminder for the essentials for those in a hurry after acquiring 
the html css and javascript fundamentals.
What else to say? I hope that in addition to helping myself, this attempt 
will also help others interested.
